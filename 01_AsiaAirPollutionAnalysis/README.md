# Assignment 01: Sampling 

This repository contains starter code for your first assignment in EDS 222, which is focused on sampling strategies.

The structure of the newly-cloned repository is as follows:

```
repo
|
-- README.md
|
-- .gitignore
|
-- R
   |
   -- assignment-01.Rmd
```

You should clone this repo as you learned during summer session. Then, open up the `R/assignment-01.Rmd` file where you will find the questions and basic template for providing your answers. You should answer each question by inserting `R` code chunks in the relevant spaces. Whenever you "knit" this `R/assignment-01.Rmd` file, you will produce the corresponding `R/assignment-01.md` (i.e. Markdown) and `R/assignment-01.html` (i.e. HTML) files, as well as some auxilliary folders. Don't worry about those now.

Please pay attention when I ask you to comment on your results in addition to coding them up.
