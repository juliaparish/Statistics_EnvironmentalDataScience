# Assignment 02: Summary statistics and probability density functions 

This repository contains starter code for your Assignment 02 in EDS 222, which is focused on probability density functions and summary statistics.

The structure of the newly-cloned repository is as follows:

```
repo
|
-- README.md
|
-- .gitignore
|
-- R
   |
   -- assignment-02.Rmd
```

You should clone this repo as you learned during summer session. Then, open up the `R/assignment-02.Rmd` file where you will find the questions and basic template for providing your answers. You should answer each question by inserting `R` code chunks in the relevant spaces. Whenever you "knit" this `R/assignment-02.Rmd` file, you will produce the corresponding `R/assignment-02.md` (i.e. Markdown) and `R/assignment-02.html` (i.e. HTML) files, as well as some auxilliary folders. Don't worry about those now.

Please pay attention when I ask you to comment on your results in addition to coding them up. 

## Grade

Total: 9.5/11
Points lost: 

- 1.3, -0.25, incomplete interpretation 
- 2.3, -0.25, incomplete interpretation for precipitation variability 
- 2.6, -0.5, incorrect interpretation
- 2.7, -0.5, incorrect interpretation

Really nice data visualizations. I'd recommend spending less time on perfecting the aesthetics of output and more on interpretation of your findings. Question 1.4 has an incorrect value for one of the distributions that looks like it's a typo?
