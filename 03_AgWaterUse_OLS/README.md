# Assignment 03: Relationships between variables 

This repository contains starter code for your Assignment 03 in EDS 222, which is focused on quantifying and visualizing relationships between two random variables.

The structure of the newly-cloned repository is as follows:

```
repo
|
-- README.md
|
-- .gitignore
|
-- R
   |
   -- assignment-03.Rmd
```

You should clone this repo as you learned during summer session. Then, open up the `R/assignment-03.Rmd` file where you will find the questions and basic template for providing your answers. You should answer each question by inserting `R` code chunks in the relevant spaces. Whenever you "knit" this `R/assignment-03.Rmd` file, you will produce the corresponding `R/assignment-03.md` (i.e. Markdown) and `R/assignment-03.html` (i.e. HTML) files, as well as some auxilliary folders. Don't worry about those now.

Please pay attention when I ask you to comment on your results in addition to coding them up. 

## Grade

Total: 5.25/7
Points lost: 
- 1.2, -.25, no intuition given (but great use of the penguins data for testing your math!)
- 2.2, -.75, incorrect interpretation of regression coefficients, see answer key
- 2.3, -.5, no connection to your math in question 1
- 3, -.25, no mention of the property of OLS that is not upheld
