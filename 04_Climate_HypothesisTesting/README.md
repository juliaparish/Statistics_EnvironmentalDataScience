# Assignment 04: Hypothesis testing and time series

This repository contains starter code for your Assignment 04 in EDS 222, which is focused on hypothesis testing and time series analysis.

The structure of the newly-cloned repository is as follows:

```
repo
|
-- README.md
|
-- .gitignore
|
-- R
   |
   -- assignment-04.Rmd
```

You should clone this repo as you learned during summer session. Then, open up the `R/assignment-04.Rmd` file where you will find the questions and basic template for providing your answers. You should answer each question by inserting `R` code chunks in the relevant spaces. Whenever you "knit" this `R/assignment-04.Rmd` file, you will produce the corresponding `R/assignment-04.md` (i.e. Markdown) and `R/assignment-04.html` (i.e. HTML) files, as well as some auxilliary folders. Don't worry about those now.

Please pay attention when I ask you to comment on your results in addition to coding them up.
